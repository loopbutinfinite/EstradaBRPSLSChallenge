### Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game API Challenge

### Description: Made an API that replicates the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game where the user makes a choice from the 5 options and the computer at random, makes their choice. Following the rules of the game, the API returns an endpoint back to the user, returning back to them the decision they chose, along with the choice that the CPU made and whether the user won, lost, or tied with against the CPU. The API is also hosted on Microsoft Azure.

### Peer Review (Name Here) - Carlos Lopez all the backend works well the issue is in the front end but its not required for this assignment
