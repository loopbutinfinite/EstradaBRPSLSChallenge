### Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game API Project

### Description: Made a full stack project that replicates the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game. It consists of 4 modes; Player v. CPU, Player v. Player (1 round), Player v. Player (Best of 5), Player v. Player (Best of 5). The project utilizes an API to handle the backend for the Player v. CPU game mode where the endpoint received from the API is the result of who won. Frontend is handled utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a User Interface for the game, where logic is done in JavaScript for the game modes that are tied to HTML elements.
